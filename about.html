            <h2>Fred the Baker Baking Company</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Fred the Baker Baking Company, where our passion for donuts is as sweet as the treats we
                create! Founded by Fred, a master baker with decades of experience, our company has been dedicated to
                spreading joy through delicious, handcrafted donuts.</p>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Fred the Baker started his journey in a small bakery, where he would wake up before dawn to prepare
                fresh, mouth-watering donuts for his community. Over the years, his love for baking and commitment to
                quality earned him a loyal following. As the demand for his delectable creations grew, Fred decided to
                take a step back from the kitchen and let technology carry on his legacy.</p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>At Fred the Baker Baking Company, we believe that everyone deserves a little sweetness in their lives.
                Our mission is to bring joy and happiness to people through our innovative donut-making experiences.
                With the introduction of the Donut Maker Clicker game, we aim to keep Fred's love for donuts alive and
                engage a new generation of donut enthusiasts.</p>
            <h3>Why Donuts?</h3>
            <p>Donuts are not just a treat; they are a celebration of life’s little moments. Whether it’s a morning
                coffee break, a birthday party, or a simple treat after a long day, donuts have a unique way of bringing
                people together. At Fred the Baker Baking Company, we want to share that joy with you, one virtual donut
                at a time!</p>
            <h3>Join Our Journey</h3>
            <p>We invite you to join us in this delicious adventure. Play the Donut Maker Clicker game, create your
                virtual donuts, and help us celebrate the legacy of Fred the Baker. Together, let’s make the world a
                sweeter place!</p>
